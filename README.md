# Ivy dependency plugin

A plugin that can insert a library dependency in an Apache Ivy file using the Maven Artifact searcher.

## How to use

1. Install plugin
2. Open an ivy.xml file in the project
3. Right-click on the file contents and select "insert dependency"
4. Select an artifact by searching for artifact or class
5. Dependency is inserted into your ivy.xml file
6. You can now use Ant or the IvyIDEA plugin to pull the dependency from maven



## Todo

- Version and deploy the plugin so other people can use it more easily
- Still in its infancy; insertion works by String manipulation so nothing fancy
